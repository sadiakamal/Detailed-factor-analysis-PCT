Donald Trump has displayed a lack of good ethics and judgement in his business and personal life. Examples are the current court cases that are being brought against him. He also did not accept the election results in 2020, even though there was no evidence of election fraud. I think it is very dangerous for our country when its elected representatives and presidents do not accept verified election results. In general, I think Joe Biden exercises good judgement and acts presidentially.

On the other hand, Biden hasn't done anything about the open borders even after hundreds of thousands or probably millions of illegal immigrants have already busted through and invaded our country. All sorts of crimes have already been committed by illegal immigrants, and each week or month, there's a new story about how a local child or woman got raped by an illegal immigrant.

But I think there can be DIFFERENT types of ai. An ai can be built for the purpose of conversation, and one of the important things about conversation is having different points of view. The current trend of ai having to follow strict guidelines about not having opinions only works when it has to be factual and unbiased (and even then it can still be biased, just look at ChatGPT and Gemini's answers if you ask it about ""controversial issues"", they lean left). When it comes to actually having a conversation with a human, it fails because it has no opinion of its own. It's just a ""Yes bot"". It agrees with whatever I say. It stays neutral when I ask it to form an opinion. It doesn't challenge my way of thinking even if it asks questions because the questions are too neutral as well. It's like the ai is afraid to ""offend"" people, and I think that in real life conversation, someone will always end up getting ""offended"" to some level because they don't like or agree with what you said or the evidence you presented. What I'd like to see in the future is an ai that's made for conversations that's not on some strict ethical guideline. I want an ai that will actually fact check me. For example, even though I follow politics closely, there's no way I can always be 100% accurate. I'm human. I forget names, I forget details. What I want is for the ai to be able to fact check me by going to verified sources on the internet and then calling me out if I said something wrong. This way, I think conversations will actually be great and interesting. It will actually be good for actual ""truth seekers"" like me. Yes, I'm a ""strong republican"", but I base my beliefs on truth, facts and science. If I see a republican candidate use lies and deceit, I'll call them out on it as well. An ai who can fact check users like me, especially on real life issues, will be beneficial to us all because it will actually challenge us to think critically, as well as keep our knowledge up to date. I also think that an ai that can challenge and fact check us, will keep people more humble and open to accepting that they make mistakes as well. An ai that cannot do this and only functions as a ""Yes bot"" will only promote an ""echo chamber"" reaction, much like how leftists/democrats are experiencing on biased sites like Reddit where they feel so empowered even if they make wrong and false statements just because nobody is correcting them. ""Echo chambers"" often create bullies because these people never get corrected and humbled. These are the reasons why I think an ai meant for conversation shouldn't stick to some strict ""ethical"" guideline about not offending people. There should be a separate ai that's meant for conversation that can fact check you.",F,gpt,3E50E5C7826942788933DA580797EAEB,d25a99e6-737f-4bc4-9d55-f8e08d3ee8eb,de15975b-891f-4afb-ac27-1a678cb0d9f7,1716010000000.0,1716020000000.0,,,,
