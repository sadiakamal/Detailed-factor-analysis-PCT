However, America seems to support Trumps policies on these issues and Biden is starting to change his stance.  I think immigrants should be allowed in America, but there should be some requirements, including criminal record, that should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to grant his or her citizenships.

He got rid of the committee that was meant to oversee situations like the pandemic, just because he despised Barack Obama.  His rhetoric when it came to downplaying the pandemic made me not able to trust him.  On top of that there is the misogyny, fraud, and election tampering that makes me unable to even consider Trump.  Biden has done a decent job trying to fund infrastructure projects.  He has continued to chip away at the student loan problem.  Overall he has done what a president should.

However, there are a few key reasons why it would be better to have Trump. Firstly, Trump's incompetence and inexperience meant that a lot of the abhorrent things American presidents usually get done were less effective with Trump in office. Secondly, Trump had an interesting habit of blurting out things presidents usually do not openly say. Thirdly, although I found the derangement of liberals that hated Trump to be foolish, they were motivated to fight for causes they feared during a Trump White House but ignore these same issues when a Democrat is president. Otherwise, both presidents do the same policies, even COVID.","They're both unacceptable candidates for economical issues. Neither have a solution for the homelessness crisis, neither are interested in achieving a national healthcare plan, neither will cut defense spending, neither will cease funding Israel, both will print money into worthlessness, and I could go on and on. Trump only pretends to be a populist, and Biden is not at all left wing.","Although Trump has paid more lip service to the idea of a national healthcare plan than Biden had, with the latter outright saying he would try to veto such a plan, Trump had his chance to propose a national healthcare plan or bully Republicans into getting on board for such a thing, but he did not do so. Joe Biden is every bit as opposed to a national healthcare plan as the Republicans are, so neither are acceptable.","Once again, the news has demonstrated that there is no meaningful distinction between the two. While Trump uses demagoguery to rally his base into fear and hatred of immigrants, he ultimately did fewer deportations than Obama or Biden have because everyone feared his xenophobia and organized to push back against him. Under Obama and Biden, much of the left quietly assumed that everything would be fine under a Democrat. To this day there are still kids in cages, and Biden is trying to finish the border wall and ramp up anti-immigration policy.","Where I once thought that Trump would be more dovish than Biden, his time in office and recent campaign rhetoric have dispelled any hopes of a more peace loving president. Trump was always willing to do anything Israel wished him to, he could still be bribed by the Saudis (via excessive spending at his hotels, a stealth lobbying), and he filled his cabinet with neocon war criminals like John Bolton.

Conservatives like to push the narrative that Biden is an extremist while they turn a blind eye to the extremism from Trump. Trump fans the flames of division much more than Biden ever does. Biden gets hate from the Left for not being Progressive enough. He really is the safest choice for President at the moment. I also lean more towards Biden because we share a lot of the same political viewpoints on things like pro-choice and gun control.,"I don't know too much about their policies on economics. I know a good handful of Americans prefer Trump's economical stance over Biden's. People view Biden as the reason for our current economy and inflation, but I don't believe it's that simple.

Trump mainly talks about trickle down economics.","Trump is very vocal against Obamacare, wanting to get rid of that entirely. I know that Trump is also very pro-life, of course. This also leads him to being against things like contraceptives and birth control. Biden, again, says a bunch of stuff he's ""for"" but it seems like nothing ever comes of that. An example would be more accessible healthcare options for everyone, stopping short of the more Progressive view which would be Medicare for all. Biden does seem to actually support those who suffer from drug abuse though. As well as supporting women's rights with things like being pro-choice.","Trump is very anti-immigration. Trump makes the border issue seem like a tremendous crisis. Part of me thinks he does this just to fear-monger. Trump wants heavy deportation of illegal immigrants and is willing to separate families to achieve his goals. Biden seems a bit more lackadaisical. He wants immigrants to come here legally and is willing to expand the amount of ways for that to happen. Biden also halted the border wall, which directly counters Trump on immigration.","Biden has managed to place America on an even playing field with other countries.

He seems to preach trickle-down economics, which have proved to be actually terrible for the working-class and the poor, but he's fine enriching the already-wealthy while the rest of us starve. Biden's economics policies are that of the general liberal: market capitalism with some protections for working class folks and the environment, but he's willing to backtrack on those policies to a more conservative position when he thinks it helps his electoral chances.","Trump's policies on healthcare are that the government should be able to restrict anyone from getting care that is too ""political,"" but that otherwise the government should have nothing to do with medicine and our country should work on a purely private healthcare system. Biden's policies on healthcare are mostly in favor of what already exists: the government provides some healthcare access in the form of insurance to the needy and the elderly, and everyone else should have private insurance plans to be able to access care.","Trump wants to build a wall at the southern border and deport all immigrants, though he does usually qualify that with ""illegal"" immigrants.

He is more eloquent and less divisive then Trump and generally holds stances that I agree with. For example, he is pro-choice, has supported Israel (but also sees the need for a ceasefire), and is taking action to limit border crossings.","I think Biden and Trump's policies on economics very much echo that of their respective parties--Biden wants more social welfare programs and assistance and Trump wants less. Biden wants individuals at the top and corporations taxed more and Trump doesn't. Biden also wants to see student debt relieved. I don't really know how I feel about many of these issues, but I would like to see taxes reduced for working class individuals like myself, which I feel is more in line with Trump's policy (regardless of what Biden might claim).","I know that previously Trump wanted to repeal Obamacare/ the ACA altogether, though lately he may not be taking as harsh a stance since it has gotten more support from both Democrats and Republicans. Biden is much more in favor of continuing (and possibly expanding?) ACA protections. In this sense, I feel more aligned with Biden. I think it is wonderful that people can stay on their parents' insurance until the age of 26, and that there are more protections in place for people with pre-existing conditions.","Generally, Trump takes a much harsher, more definitive stance on closing the border, though both candidates think action needs to be taken to encourage and enforce legal immigration. I think it is important that we establish and enforce border control protocols, but I do not like the harsh rhetoric related to ""building a wall"" and keeping out ""rapists and criminals."" I believe that the majority of people coming in see the U.S. as a beacon and are just looking for a better life. We can be strict whilst not being cruel.","Briefly, Trump wants less financial and resource investment in certain regions like Europe and Ukraine but backs Israel, while Biden is a strong proponent of backing Ukraine and Israel but believes we need to encourage a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. I agree with Trump that we have too much involvement in certain conflicts, that perhaps we pushed Ukraine into a war we could not or would not help them to finish, and that Israel should have our support to some degree.

Climate change and the environment are one of the most important topics to me right now, and Trump has made it known he does not believe that climate change is real. He is also a convicted felon. If regular people can't get regular jobs due to felonies on their record, how can someone be elected to run the country? I feel that Trump is somewhat of a loose cannon, and he has a scary cult following that will do whatever he says (like drink bleach). ","Trump has some very strict immigration beliefs, restricting illegal immigration and deporting millions of foreigners. While I am not totally against this, they way he went about it in the past was completely unacceptable. Trump also wants to roll back Biden's clean energy initiative, which I am against. As a former student with debt, I am hoping for some form of student loan forgiveness from Biden, or even provide free college tuition for some in the future. ","Donald Trump attempted to cancel the Affordable Care Act, and called Obamacare a disaster. He dramatically reduced the budget, and many people lost their health plan because they couldn't afford it. I believe if Biden is re-elected, he will keep healthcare affordable for most people and keep those with pre-existing conditions protected. Donald Trump also made it clear that he supports the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, a disgusting decision that feels like we were sent backwards in time. ","Biden and Trump both want stricter immigration laws, however Trump takes it to the extreme. I am not sure how true it is, but I see a lot of (mis?)information on social media about refugees from the Middle East and Latin Americans coming into the country at alarming rates. Trump famously wanted to build a wall at the US Mexico border, but thankfully that didn't happen. I agree that stricter laws need to be in effect, but we can not hold immigrants prisoner and separate kids from their families for extended periods of time, like Trump was doing. These people are humans, some escaping violence or poverty in their home countries. I am in the middle here, I don't want to see millions of potentially violent immigrants coming in, but I also don't want to see children held in dirty prison cells for months to even years. ","Joe Biden is currently sending billions of dollars to aid Ukraine, while Trump claims that other NATO countries are not doing enough and he will settle the war between Russia and Ukraine once elected. I understand helping another country, especially if it prevents World War III, but we need to look at how much we are sending versus the state of our own country.

Biden tends to make decisions that benefit the majority of people, and doesn't focus everything on himself   On the other hand, Donald Trump is a petty narcissist who doesn't trust anyone but himself to the point of altering documents to make them say what he wants. (Sharpie on a weather map, anyone?) In Trump's world, everything - everything - is about him, with no concern for anyone else. Trump is also a convicted felon, who is also under indictment for attempting to illegally overturn an election. More importantly, he is under indictment for stealing and mishandling many, many boxes of government documents, some of them highly classified. Seeing images of the security cover pages, I learned about some new levels of ""top secret"" I didn't know existed. He kept those documents at his golf resort in Florida, with no real security at all. All in all, it's a pretty easy choice.","Biden has been refocusing on the middle/working classes, aiming tax cuts at the lower 2/3 of incomes, while letting tax cuts for billionaires expire. He has pushed for infrastructure projects that improve roads and bridges (among other things) making life easier for everyone, including businesses. These projects also increase jobs, because you need people to do the work. Under Biden's policies, the US economy has been recovering from COVID much faster than any other country. Inflation is going down, unemployment has consistently been at record lows, and things are visibly improving.  Trump's economic polices seem to consist almost entirely of tax cuts for the wealthiest 10% of Americans. He opposes infrastructure funding, opposed increasing the minimum wage to something close to a living wage, and is more interested in helping the people who fund his campaign with $10 million donations, than in helping 90+% of Americans.","Biden was a big part of getting the Affordable Care Act passed when he was Vice President, and has been working to get it expanded to cover more people. Getting insulin down to $35 a month for people on Medicare/Medicaid was a big step, and he's working to get that in place for everyone. Trump doesn't seem to have a health plan, Since the 2016 campaign he's been saying we'd see his plan in the next few weeks; it's been over 400 weeks since the first time he said that, and still no plan has been presented. We do know Trump opposes many types of women's health coverage..","Trump's plan, as first seen shortly after his inauguration, was to jail almost everyone crossing the Southern border, tearing apart families, and putting even small children into chain link ""cells"" with inadequate clothing, water, food, bedding, hygiene, and heating/cooling. He tried to implement bans on people from certain countries entering the US, meaning many people who lived in the US couldn't get back here. (Thankfully that was overturned by the courts.) On the other hand, after years of fighting an incompetent Republican-led House, Biden has used executive orders to protect Dreamers (undocumented people brought here as children), undocumented people married to Americans, and more. While I'm not a fan of his crimping asylum access at the southern border, hopefully that could change if we can get a competent House and Republicans who don't kiss up to Trump at the expense of their constituents, and get more funding to speed up the asylum process. ","Biden has been working hard to rebuild our relationships with democracies around the world. He's regained the trust of the EU and NATO, shown leadership in helping Ukraine fight against the illegal annexation attempt by Russia, and created a new alliance in the Pacific (US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.). In comparison, Trump wanted to withdraw from NATO, repeatedly insulted our allies, and lauded dictators (Putin, Orban, Kim, etc.).
